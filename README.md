run_analysis.R -- 
If the zipped file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip is in the R working directory, this R script will end with two tidy data sets: 
1) the combined training and testing data sets
2) the average values of each variable for each activity and each subject from the first data set (this data set is printed to the working directory as SamsungSummary.txt").

CodeBook.md --
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work I performed to clean up the data.
